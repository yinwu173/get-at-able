# Refractoring the Starter Code

## About the Project
* This project aims to refractor a starter code so that when viewed, the code is accessible to its users. to better decipher and understand codes, semantic elements are incorporated and utilized.

### Acceptance Criteria
 * It is done when there are semantic HTML elements in the source code.
 * It is done when HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position.
 * It is done when the image elements have accessible alt attributes.
 * It is done weight the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
 * It is does when the title element has a concise, descriptive title.

### Getting Started

* We will first need to create a new repository with a unique name in our Github account.

* Then, we will needx to clone the starter code provided in the UCB Module 1 Challenge to our computer.

* Once the starter code has been cloned, we will need to refactor the code to meet the acceptance criteria.
