Title: Refractoring the Starter Code

About the Project
  - This Project aims to refractor a starer code so that when viewed the code is accessible to its users.

Acceptance Criteria
 - It is done when there are semantic HTML elements in the source code.
 - It is done when HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position.
 - It is done when the image elements have accessible alt attributes.
 - It is done weight the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
 - It is does when the title element has a concise, descriptive title.

Getting Started
- We will first need to create a new repository with a unique name in our Github account.
- Then, we will needx to clone the starter code provided in the UCB Module 1 Challenge to our computer.
- Once the starter code has been cloned, we will need to refactor the code to meet the acceptance criteria.
