# Refractoring the Starter Code

## About the Project

* This project aims to refractor a starter code so that when viewed, the code is accessible to its users. For its viewer to better decipher and understand codes, coders often incorporate and utilize semantic elements in their code.

## Acceptance Criteria

 * It is done when there are semantic HTML elements in the source code.

 * It is done when HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and position.

 * It is done when the image elements have accessible alt attributes.

 * It is done weight the heading attributes fall in sequential order.

 * It is does when the title element has a concise, descriptive title.

### Getting Started

* We will first need to create a new repository with a unique name in our Github account.

* Then, we will need to clone the starter code provided in the UCB Module 1 Challenge to our computer.

* Once the starter code has been cloned, we will need to refactor the code to meet the acceptance criteria.

### Hints

* Instead of div class="header" we can substitute and use the semantic element of header.

* When we see repeating CSS styles in the stylesheet, we can class the repeating styles under a single class with the same name. 

* We can add an aside element for information outside of the section content.
